                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">In Canada, Section (2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedom of expression. Nevertheless, defamation remains a criminal act that may be prosecuted under the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Section 298(1) of the Code defines defamation, or more specifically defamatory libel, as a "matter published, without lawful justification or excuse, that is likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing him [or her] to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that is designed to insult the person of or concerning whom it is published." </p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">A person who is guilty of defamation may be subject to imprisonment for a term up to two years. As such, criminal defamation is controversial, and some criticize it as unconstitutional and in violation of section 2(b) of the Charter.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Defamation is, however, more commonly litigated in the context of civil lawsuits. The main issue in a defamation case is to determine whether you can take legal action. To show a court that the other party has acted illegally, you must be able to prove three things:</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">(1) the defendant's disparaging words or insinuations specifically refer to you; (2) at least one person other than you has seen the disparaging words or insinuations; (3) in the eyes of an average person, the defendant's words or insinuations lower your reputation in the community. </p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Therefore, regular insults, simple vulgar language, or joking and mocking may not result in a strong case. Other factors may also affect a defamation case. For instance, the truthfulness of the defendant’s statements is an important consideration.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">If untrue criminal accusations are made against a plaintiff, a strong case for defamation exists. In contrast, if the statements are based on facts, however damaging to the plaintiff, they will not result in a strong case for defamation.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">If the plaintiff can present a strong case, the court will likely order the defendant to stop false allegations and disparaging statements. The plaintiff may also be able to receive monetary compensation from the defendant.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">If you think you are the victim of a defamation case, it is important to get professional help to present a strong case based upon the circumstances of your individual matter. Also, keep in mind that a limitation period exists after which you will lose your right to take legal action.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">A lawsuit in Small Claims Court can be filed against an individual or a business when the amount in dispute is $35,000 or less. However,  you may file a statement of claim in Small Claims Court for claims more than $35,000 if you waive your right to the amount over $35,000.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">If you are successful in a Small Claims Court, you are typically entitled to have reasonable disbursements and representation fees paid by the unsuccessful party. You should specifically seek such sum of money in your statement of claim at the time of filing your lawsuit.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">If you are unsuccessful, similarly the opposing party may seek costs, and you will be personally responsible for paying such costs. A successful party who is self-represented may still receive an amount not more than $500 as compensation for inconvenience and expense.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">In Small Claims Court, there are also cost consequences for a party who fails to accept a reasonable offer of settlement. If you sue someone and then offer to settle at least seven days before the trial, and if the defendant refuses to accept your offer, the court may award you up to twice the costs of your lawsuit if you win the amount of your offer or more.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Similarly, if the defendant makes a settlement offer at least seven days before the trial, and if you refuse to accept the offer, the court may award the opposing party an amount up to twice their costs from the date the offer was served. However, this rule only applies if you obtain a judgment that is as favourable as or less favourable than the terms of the offer.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0If you are suing or being sued in a Small Claims Court, it is important to get professional help in settlement negotiations, drafting a settlement offer, or responding to an offer of settlement. A licensed legal professional can evaluate your case and help you make informed decisions about agreements and settling your case prior to the trial.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Emojis are increasingly becoming part of our daily communications. Although language, and by extension forensic linguistics, have been aiding the uncovering of crimes since late 1960s, emojis have particularly entered the realm of legal discovery in recent years.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Interpreting emojis within context has become an integral part of many legal and criminal cases. The use of emojis in the legal context ranges from emoji-based secret lingo in drug dealings to workplace sexual harassment in contravention of human rights. </p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recently released a reference guide to help parents and educators decode drug-related emojis in text messages and on social media. This is due to the fact that drug dealers commonly target teenagers on social media while using emojis to go under the radar.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Some emojis are obvious, such as a mushroom🍄 representing magic mushrooms or a pill💊 representing fake prescription pills. However, decoding other emojis is more complicated. For example, Emojipedia describes a maple leaf🍁 as a reference to Canada/Canadian or more generally to the season of fall, but in drug dealers’ terminology, a maple leaf is a universal reference to drugs.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">There are other emojis that have dual meanings. For example, a blue heart💙 may appear to be a benign reference to love and support for a specific cause, such as autism awareness, but in fact a blue heart is typically used to refer to meth in drug rings. Similarly, a brown heart🤎 may be an innocent reference to racial equality and justice for peoples of color, but depending on the context it may be a specific reference to heroin.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">Further, the addition of certain emojis to innocent text messages can drastically change the meaning and function of the text message. For example, in the case of a workplace sexual harassment before the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, the employer was accused of inappropriate sexual advancements and ultimately sexual harassment and reprisal.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">When providing disclosure, the employer who was accused of sexual harassment only provided the words of each text message to the Tribunal. However, the employee who had filed the complaint submitted the full text messages including any emojis that would have been part of the text message.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">An actual text message from this case can indicate how the addition of an emoji can morph a formal and serious work-related text massage into a playful and lascivious text message. On July 8, 2014 the employer sent a text message to his employee. The employer submitted the following text message to the Tribunal: "Sorry to disturb u on your day off".</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">While in fact the text message included an emoji and was as follows: "Sorry to disturb u on your day off😛". The actual text message shows that inserting an emoji can completely change the tone of the text message. The text with emoji may further imply that the employer approves out-of-workplace relations.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">The employer in this case was found guilty of sexual harassment, poisoned work environment, and reprisal in the workplace. Although the case was decided based on multiple circumstantial factors, the use of emojis and their implications were taken into account in the Tribunal's final decision.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text mb-0">In Canada, emojis, as well as emoticons (or primitive emojis), have been considered to have evidentiary value in legal decisions at different court levels and tribunals. If you think you have a legal case that is based on language evidence, you should seek professional help. Also, keep in mind that you may benefit from hiring an expert witness to testify in your case so that the court can make an informed and educated decision.</p>
